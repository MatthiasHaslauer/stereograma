Stereograma allows you to render a high quality stereogram fast and easy.
the gui was made with Qt, and the algorithm was taken from http://www.techmind.org/stereo/stech.html

some optimizations were made by me to the specified code.

stereograma can load 3d objects in the obj format, and mostly of the image formats.

stereograma can also create anaglyph from two pictures.
